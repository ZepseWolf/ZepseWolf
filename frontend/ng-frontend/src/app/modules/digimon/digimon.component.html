        Using Flask , Mongodb and SQL. We were able to successfully 
        developed a fully interactive application that will give a cyber sleuth digimon player an edge against their opponent.

        I was mainly incharge of the login page and comparing of 2 digimon to determine a possible winner.
        We are require to work on both frontend and backend to deliever the desirable result.
