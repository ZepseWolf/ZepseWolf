        Introduction
    </div>
    <p>
        Using Angular 12 and Electron framework. I was able to successfully 
        developed a fully interactive desktop application that handles and manages Wire-Bond Capacitance Testing technology.
        I was required to participate in an Agile development process which make use of Slack, JIRA, and Bitbucket tools to ensure that the process will be smooth.

    <p>
        I was mainly incharge of creating the frontend and the electron application so that it will be able to handle MQTT topic subscription.
        To test and ensure it will work, i was also require to using rednode and rabbitMQ.
