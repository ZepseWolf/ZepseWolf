            We can see that Singapore GDP is slowing down , and is proved by inflation is decreased and interest rate decreased to encourage spending. 
            Picking from 2 global currency against SGD . We can see that the japanese Yen's value is going down rapidly while the Korean Won's value is slowly climbing stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
            This means that the japanese yen might be heading for the worse. Because even against a slowing economy (Singapore), it is still falling rapidly. 
            Or simply , avoid investing in the japanese yen at the point of this studies.
